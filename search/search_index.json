Fall 2020 Teaching Schedule A list of courses Ch4zm is teaching in Fall 2020: Blaseball 101: Intro to Blaseball Course Code: BLAB 101 Course Location: Room 5778A, Internet Hall, Hellmouth Community College Course Description: What is blaseball? Yes! The only thing that matters is the Sun. In this course you will STARE INTO THE SUN and come away with a deep reverence for the sun and a tendency to worship the most supreme high-density ball of burning gas. Blaseball 207: Contemporary Issues in Meta-Blaseballical Studies Course Code: BLAB 207 Course Location: Room 5778B, Sunbeam Hall, Hellmouth Community College Course Description: Seminar discussions of current meta-blaseballical topics, including applied, hands-on capstone clomputational projects. Blaseball 233: Modeling the Blaseball Universe Course Code: BLAB 233 Course Location: Room 5778A, Sunbeam Hall, Hellmouth Community College Course Description: A recently-published proof by Butt et al has demonstrated the logical possibility that the entire blaseball universe is merely a simulation inside of a computer - the so-called Speculatio Qui Vivimus en Machina theory. We discuss the exciting implications of this proof and explore state-of-the-art modeling strategies for simulating the blaseball universe, including clomputational strategies. Blaseball 284: Applied Blaseball Mathematics Course Code: BLAB 284 Course Location: Room 5778, Trombone Memorial Tower, Hellmouth Community College Course Description: We apply mathematics to explore fundamental questions of blaseball, such as, what was blaseball before it was blaseball? What is the topology of the interdimensional rift that was created when Moab became Hellmouth? How can Randy Marijuana's Cat Cafe be so spacious, and yet only have room for one cat at a time?
