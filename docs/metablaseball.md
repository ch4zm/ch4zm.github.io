# Metablaseball Research Laboratory (MeRL)

The Metablaseball Research Laboratory (MeRL) is a research laboratory at Hellmouth Community College. MeRL
researches ways of creating absurd, simulated versions of blaseball, modifying or adding rules, and creating
rosters of fictional players and filling in their backstories. MeRL then simulates these simple blaseball universes
using specialized mechanical devices.

Research at MeRL doesn't stop at blaseball - MeRL applies the techniques of metablaseball to other splorts.
MeRL researchers recently unveiled the internet's newest splort, [Golly](https://golly.life). Golly is based
around Conway's Game of Life, a deterministic simulation where a few simple rules lead to an emergence of complex
phenomena. Golly boils existence down to its most primitive elements, life and death, and creates a splort out of it.

The head of the Metablaseball Research Laboratory is Ch4zm of Hellmouth.
