# THE SPANKING

## Synopsis

The Shoe Thieves strike first, but the Lovers spank the Shoe Thieves with 6 runs in the fourth
and another 6 runs in the fifth, ultimately winning by 14 runs in an epic 20-6 blowout.

It is reported that at some point during the ninth inning Shoe Thieves pitcher Beasley Gloom broke down
and uttered the Lovers' safety word aloud, leading the Lovers to promptly wrap up the game.
After the game the Lovers visited the Shoe Thieves' locker room to help ice their muscles, apply soothing balm
to their bruises, and give them aromatherapy massages. Both teams issued press releases later clarifying that
The Spanking was consensual for both teams involved.
