## Fall 2020 Teaching Schedule

A list of courses Ch4zm is teaching in Fall 2020:

-----

### Blaseball 101: Intro to Blaseball

**Course Code:** BLAB 101

**Course Location:** Room 5778A, Internet Hall, Hellmouth Institute of Technology (South Campus)

**Course Description:** What is blaseball? Yes! And in this course we will ask many
other silly questions that don't matter. The only thing that matters is the Sun.
In this course you will come away with a deep reverence for the sun and a tendency
to worship the most supreme high-density ball of burning gas.

-----

### Blaseball 207: Contemporary Issues in Meta-Blaseballical Studies 

**Course Code:** BLAB 207

**Course Location:** Room 5778B, Sunbeam Hall, Hellmouth Institute of Technology (South Campus)

**Course Description:** What is metablaseball? Yes! Despite this recent development,
we discuss current meta-blaseballical topics and participate in applied, hands-on
capstone clomputational projects.

### Blaseball 303: Modeling the Blaseball Universe

**Course Code:** BLAB 303

**Course Location:** Room 5778A, Sunbeam Hall, Hellmouth Institute of Technology (South Campus)

**Course Description:** A recently-published proof by Butt et al has demonstrated the logical 
possibility that the entire blaseball universe is merely a simulation inside of a computer - the 
so-called _Speculatio Qui Vivimus en Machina_ theory. We discuss the exciting implications of this 
proof and explore state-of-the-art modeling strategies for simulating the blaseball universe, 
including clomputational strategies.

### Blaseball 384: Applied Blaseball Mathematics

**Course Code:** BLAB 384

**Course Location:** Room 5778, Trombone Memorial Tower, Hellmouth Institute of Technology (Main Campus)

**Course Description:** We apply mathematics to explore fundamental questions of blaseball,
such as, what was blaseball before it was blaseball? What is the topology of the interdimensional
rift that was created when Moab became Hellmouth? How can Randy Marijuana's Cat Cafe be so spacious,
and yet only have room for one cat at a time?
