# THE DEFLOWERING

## Synopsis

The most lopsided shutout of the Discipline Era, this shutout pitted Shoe Thieves ace Matteo Prestige against
Zeboriah Wilson. The Shoe Thieves laid it on thick as shoe polish, taking a four-run lead in the third inning and
never looking back. The Flower were limited to just 4 baserunners and the Shoe Thieves finished out their sweep of
the Flowers, going on to lose to the Pies in 4 games in the Season 2 Internet Championship.
