# GRAB THE TIGERS BY THE HORNE

## Synopsis

The Season 3 Tigers seemed unstoppable with Jessica Telephone and Landry Violence in their lineup, going on a
12-game winning streak from Day 78 to Day 89 and roaring through the end of the season into the playoffs (in which
they would win the Season 3 Internet Championship over the Millennials and compel a "Tame the Tigers" decree for
the Season 4 election). But they hit a speed bump when they played the Wild Wings on Day 90. In the bottom of the
eighth, with one swing of Lawrence Horne's bat, the Tigers' hopes of extending their winning streak were dashed.
Horne's 3-run shot put 3 runs on the board for the Wild Wings, and the Tigers failed to come back in the bottom of
the ninth.
