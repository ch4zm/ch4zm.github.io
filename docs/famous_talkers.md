# THE TALKERS HAVE LEFT THE BUILDING

## Synopsis

In the Season 4 Internet Series semi-finals, the Tigers and Moist Talkers had gone back and forth - Tigers, then
Moist Talkers, then Tigers, then Moist Talkers. The last game of the 5-game series was a nail-biter, at least until
the bottom of the 11th, when the Talkers apparently mistakenly left the stadium thinking they had won the game.
Meanwhile, back at the Sixth Circle Stadium, the Tigers piled on 5 runs before the Moist Talkers realized what was
going on, in a stunning Game 5 shaming of the Moist Talkers.
