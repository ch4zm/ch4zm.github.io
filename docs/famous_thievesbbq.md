# SHOE THIEVES HAVE A BBQ

## Synopsis

The Shoe Thieves, down 0-2 in the series in the first round of the Season 2 playoffs, came roaring back into Game 3
and set a record for the highest-scoring shutout in the Discipline era, a record they would break just 5 days later
against the Flowers (and again with their ace Matteo Prestige on the mound). Prestige struck out 8 and limited the
Steaks to just a few scattered singles. The Shoe Thieves went on to win the series 3-2.
