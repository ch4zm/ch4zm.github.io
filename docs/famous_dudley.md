# DUDLEY SHAMES DUDLEY

## Synopsis

In this high-scoring, high-intensity contest, the Shoe Thieves and Millennials traded run after run. Down by 2 in
the 8th inning, the Shoe Thieves clawed their way back to a tie, only to be shamed in the bottom of the 10th by the
Millennials, in a nail-biter finish in Battin' Island. With the game tied 10-10 going into the bottom of the 10th,
the first two Millennials were retired. That brought Wesley Dudley to the plate - Dudley on Dudley. On an 0-2
count, Wesley Dudley hit a double. With the winning run in scoring position for the Millennials, Schneider Bendie
came to the plate, and sitting on a 2-0 count, found a pitch they liked, and smoked it past the shortstop, scoring
Wesley Dudley and shaming Kevin Dudley.

NOTE: Vorhees was both on first and at bat at the top of the eighth inning, and scored both of the Shoe Thieves'
runs.
